    <ol>
      <li>For question 6, I left the code block blank for the else if which caused
          nothing to happen and it moved to the next loop iteration. When I tried
          out putting break inside the else if code block it broke out of the loop
          altogether and stopped. Is there a standard code of some sort in this case
          that would tell the else if statement to "do nothing but continue the loop"?</li>
